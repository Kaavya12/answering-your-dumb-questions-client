            <p class="lead"> Look around! You will definitely find something you have a question about. Ask it here! This is a platform where you can ask any question related to STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics). It doesn't matter whether the question is simple or complex, about something around you or something millions of kilometres away, all you need to do is ask.</p>

                <p>
                    So here's why I started... I had a question. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was a regular observation actually, why is the moon white and the sun orange? It seemed quite unintuitive to me at first, so I decided to make a hypothesis and try to find the answer. While doing some experiments, I realised how wonderful I felt to actually learn by doing! Now, if you're wondering what the reason is, you can check it out <a>here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what that entire experience made me realise is that we all have questions that we want to as, we all have something that we want to know. We just need to ask someone, we just need to experiment and we just need to dig deeper to find the answer to our problems, even if they may seem dumb.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want this to be a place where we can all ask and answer questions, where we can learn and grow! You may have thousands of questions you might want to ask, or if you don't, you may see someone else's question and scratch your brain over it. You may design experiments/models to solve your own or someone else's problems and you can share it for everyone to see!
                </p>
